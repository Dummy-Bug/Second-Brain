### How it works

- **Real-time matching**: As you type, the system checks for partial matches (substrings) in its data.
- **Dynamic suggestions**: A dropdown list appears with potential matches that become more specific as you add more characters.
- **User feedback**: Offers immediate results, reducing the need to fully type out queries and preventing spelling mistakes.

### Examples

- **Google Search**: Shows popular search queries as you type, like typing "how to" and seeing "how to make sourdough".
- **E-commerce sites**: Suggests products as you type, e.g., typing "shir" might show "shirt," "shorts," "shoes".
