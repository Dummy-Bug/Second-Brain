## User Scale Assumptions

`Monthly Active Users (MAU) ≈ 1 Billion Daily Active Users (DAU) ≈ 20% of MAU ≈ 200 Million`

---

## Search Behavior Assumptions

`Average searches per user per day ≈ 5`

Total searches per day:

`200M users × 5 searches ≈ 1 Billion searches/day`

---

## Average QPS Calculation

Seconds per day:

`24 × 60 × 60 = 86,400 seconds`

Approximate baseline QPS:

`1,000,000,000 / 100,000 ≈ 10,000 QPS`

Rounded for engineering safety margin.

## Typeahead API Call Estimation (With Debouncing)

Because client uses debouncing:

- Not every keystroke triggers API call.
    
- User typically pauses typing multiple times.
    

Assumption:

`3 to 5 API calls per search interaction`

Worst case estimation:

`5 API calls × 10,000 QPS`

Result:

`≈ 50,000 Typeahead QPS (Average)`

---

## Write Path Load (Search Submission)

Assumption:

`50% of DAU generate new queries`

Calculation:

`50% × 20M DAU = 10M write events per day`

Average write QPS:

`10,000,000 / 100,000 ≈ 100 QPS`

Write load is small compared to read traffic.

---

## Peak Traffic Estimation

Autocomplete traffic is bursty.

Apply peak multiplier:

`Peak factor ≈ 20x`

Peak QPS calculation:

`20 × 5 × 10,000`

Result:

`≈ 1,000,000 QPS (Peak)`
