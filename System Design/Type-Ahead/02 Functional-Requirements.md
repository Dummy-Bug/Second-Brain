### 1. Autocomplete Suggestions

- System must return typeahead suggestions for a given prefix.
    
- Suggestions should update as the user types.
    

---

### 2. Ranking by Popularity

- Return **top 10 results** sorted by query frequency.
    
- Ranking based on:
    
    - Historical search count.
        
    - Recency boost.
        
    - Optional personalization weight.
        

---

### 3. Prefix Length Constraints

- Autocomplete should trigger only when:
    

```
3 <= prefix length <= 20
```

Reason:

- Avoid useless single-character queries.
    
- Prevent excessive backend load.
    
- Improve signal quality.
    

---

### 4. Personalized Suggestions (Optional Advanced Feature)

- Results should adapt to user context:
    
    - Location.
        
    - Search history.
        
    - Language.
        
    - Device signals.
        

Note:  
This is primarily an ML ranking problem layered on top of base retrieval.

### 5. Query Types

There are two distinct request types:

---

#### Typeahead Query (Read Path)

Triggered when user types in search box.

Example:

```
"par"
```

Purpose:

- Fetch suggestions.
    
- Read-heavy.
    
- Latency sensitive.
    

---

#### Search Submission Query (Write Path)

Triggered when user clicks a suggestion or submits search.

Example:

```
"paris city cost of living"
```

Purpose:

- Update popularity counters.
    
- Feed ranking pipeline.
    
- Write-heavy.
    

---

## Client-Side Optimization

---

### Debouncing

To avoid sending requests on every keystroke:

- Client must debounce input events.
    

Example policy:

```
Debounce interval: 250ms
```

Behavior:

- User types continuously → no request sent.
    
- User pauses typing → request triggered.
    

Benefits:

- Reduces QPS.
    
- Prevents backend overload.
    
- Improves perceived responsiveness.
    

---

### Additional Client Guards

- Cancel in-flight requests when new keystroke arrives.
    
- Do not send request if prefix length < 3.
    
- Cache last prefix response locally.
