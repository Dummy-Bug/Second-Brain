Shortened URLs help make your content more memorable and easy to share.

## What are the benefits of using a URL Shortener?

Shortening your links should be a must-have in your social media strategy. Here are four of the top benefits of using a URL Shortener:

- **It makes your links more friendly and memorable:** It’s more likely that your followers will remember a polished-up, short link like buff.ly/url-shortener, rather than a long link like buffer.com/resources/url-shorteners. Shortened URLs can be a great opportunity to extend your branding into the shortened links you share on social media.
    
- **You can track your link’s performance:** Many URL Shortener tools offer tracking and analytics features so that you can keep track of how many clicks your link receives and where the clicks are coming from.
    
- **It increases click-through rates:** A shortened URL that looks polished and clean tends to get more link clicks than a long URL because they are more visually appealing and because most social media users are used to shortened links nowadays.
    
- **They use fewer characters:**When it comes to social media, every character counts, especially for Twitter. By using a URL Shortener, you can turn your long URLs into much shorter ones, thus cutting down your character count by quite a bit.
