Java is a multi-platform, object-oriented, and network-centric language.

### 1. **Multi-platform**:

Java is often referred to as "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA). This means you can write a Java program on one operating system (e.g., Windows), and it can run on any other operating system (e.g., Linux, macOS) **without modification**. This is possible because Java programs are compiled into an intermediate form called **bytecode**, which runs on the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**. The JVM is available on most operating systems, making Java platform-independent.

### 2. **Object-oriented**:

Java is built around the concept of **objects**. In object-oriented programming (OOP), everything revolves around **objects** that represent real-world entities. Key principles of OOP like **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and **abstraction** are deeply embedded in Java’s design.

Essentially, Java encourages you to model software in a way that mirrors the real world—by breaking things into objects and defining relationships between them.

### 3. **Network-centric**:

Java has built-in features for creating **networked applications**. It provides high-level APIs that make it easy to connect and communicate over networks (like the internet) using protocols such as **TCP/IP**, **HTTP**, **FTP**, etc. It’s used widely in web applications, distributed systems, and cloud-based services.

- **Java Networking APIs**: Java’s libraries include classes like `Socket`, `URL`, and `HttpURLConnection` to handle networking tasks such as making HTTP requests, communicating between systems, and sending/receiving data across a network.

This makes Java ideal for developing applications that need to interact over the web, making it a strong choice for **web services**, **distributed computing**, and **cloud applications**.
