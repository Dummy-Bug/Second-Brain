**Java** is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed for having lesser implementation dependencies. It is a computing platform for application development.

- **General-purpose**:
    
    - Java can be used to build a wide variety of applications, from web services to mobile apps, desktop software, games, and more. It's not restricted to a single domain like some specialized languages.
- **Class-based**:
    
    - Java follows the **class-based** structure, meaning that everything in Java revolves around defining and using classes (blueprints for creating objects).
- **Object-oriented**:
    
    - Java is designed to follow **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles, where the focus is on creating objects that contain both data and methods to operate on that data.
    - This helps in code reuse, scalability, and maintainability, making Java ideal for large-scale applications.
- **Lesser Implementation Dependencies**:
    
    - Java’s **“Write Once, Run Anywhere”** principle is achieved because Java code is compiled into **bytecode**, which runs on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This means you don’t have to rewrite your code for different operating systems.
- **Computing Platform**:
    
    - **Java Platform**: Java isn’t just a programming language but also a platform that includes the **JVM**, **Java libraries**, and tools like the **Java Development Kit (JDK)** and **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**, which are necessary for writing, compiling, and running Java applications.
    - It provides everything you need for application development—from simple desktop applications to complex enterprise systems, mobile applications (like Android apps), and distributed web services.

### **Key Differences**:

- **Class-based programming** focuses on defining **classes** as blueprints to create objects.
- **OOP** is a broader concept, where objects and the four pillars (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction) are the primary focus. Classes are just one way to achieve OOP, but they aren’t the only way.
  
  In **prototype-based** systems, you create objects directly, and these objects can be linked to other objects, allowing them to "inherit" properties and methods from the linked object (prototype). JavaScript is a prime example of a language that uses prototype-based inheritance.

Here’s a simplified breakdown of how it works:

1. **Create an Object**: You create an object, which can contain properties and methods.
2. **Inherit from Another Object**: New objects can be created based on an existing object, and they automatically inherit all the properties and methods of that original object (its prototype).
3. **Extend or Override**: The new objects can be extended by adding new properties or methods, or even overriding inherited ones.
