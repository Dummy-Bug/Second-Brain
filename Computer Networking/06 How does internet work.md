- **Search Engines**:
    
    - Search engines are specialized software systems that search and index web pages across the internet.
    - They retrieve relevant information based on user queries or keywords.
    - They do not display web pages directly but provide links to relevant pages.
- **Web Browsers**:
    
    - [Web browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/How_browsers_work) are applications that retrieve and display web pages and other online content.
    - They interpret and render HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web technologies to present content visually.
    - Users interact with web browsers to navigate to specific websites, view content, and interact with online services.

### Web Server

A [web server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Web_mechanics/What_is_a_web_server) is a specialized computer or software that stores, processes, and delivers web pages to clients over the internet or an intranet. Here's a breakdown of what a web server does and its key components:

1. **Storage and Processing**:
    
    - A web server stores web pages, images, videos, and other content files. These files are usually stored in a specific directory structure accessible to the web server software.
    - It processes requests from clients (like web browsers) to retrieve and deliver these files.
2. **Handling Client Requests**:
    
    - When a user requests a web page or a resource (like an image or a video), their web browser sends a request to the web server.
    - The web server receives this request, locates the requested file or resource, and sends it back to the client over the internet.
3. **Protocol Support**:
    
    - Web servers typically support HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (HTTP Secure) protocols. HTTP is used for transmitting web pages and other web resources, while HTTPS adds encryption using SSL/TLS to secure the communication.
4. **Examples of Web Servers**:
    
    - **Apache HTTP Server**: One of the most widely used open-source web servers, known for its flexibility and robustness.
    - **Nginx**: A lightweight, high-performance web server and reverse proxy server known for its scalability and speed.
    - **Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS)**: A web server created by Microsoft for use with Windows Server operating systems.
    - **Node.js**: While primarily a JavaScript runtime, Node.js can also be used to create web servers for handling HTTP requests.
